# One-Time-Pad-Style-Notebook-XOR-Base64-
I built a Python tool that encrypts usernames, passwords, and notes using an XOR-based one-time-pad style system. It outputs a short, notebook-friendly string you can handwrite. The key is kept separate and can be destroyed after use, keeping entries secure even if the notebook is stolen.
